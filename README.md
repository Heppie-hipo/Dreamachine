🧠 Dreamachine — A Consciousness Visualizer Built in Code

**Dreamachine** is a first-of-its-kind, fully digital, open-source light-and-sound simulator inspired by Brion Gysin’s original Dreamachine — a flickering stroboscopic experience known to evoke deep states of consciousness, altered perception, and even dream-like visions with eyes closed.

> "The Dreamachine is the first art object to be experienced with the eyes closed."

⚠️ Disclaimer
Dreamachine is a potent audiovisual experience designed to explore altered states of perception.

Due to the nature of stroboscopic flicker, it may trigger seizures or other adverse effects in individuals who are photosensitive, have a history of epilepsy, or are affected by light-triggered conditions.

Please:

Use in a calm, safe environment

Avoid use if you're prone to seizures or uncertain of your sensitivity

Close your eyes during use (as intended by the original Dreamachine)

Take breaks and listen to your body
